Our model offers insight into how GLP-1 receptor agonists regulate satiety through 
hypothalamic pathways, emphasizing the sequential roles of POMC activation, α-MSH release, and AgRP 
inhibition. A key finding is the two-phase suppression of hunger signals: an early response via α-MSH and 
a sustained effect through delayed GABAergic inhibition of AgRP neurons. This dynamic may help explain 
the prolonged appetite-suppressing effects of GLP-1 therapies, even as drug levels decline. The model is 
limited in scope, focusing only on the hypothalamus and excluding downstream physiological effects such 
as insulin secretion or gastric emptying. It also omits signaling pathways like G-protein cascades, glutamate, 
and leptin which are not directly related to the hypothalamus, and includes parameter values that were 
partially inferred or assumed, introducing uncertainty. Despite these constraints, the model holds value for 
preclinical and clinical applications. By capturing the timing and strength of central satiety signals, it could 
be extended to simulate dose-response behavior or estimate EC50 like values. These insights may help guide 
drug optimization and dosing strategies for GLP-1 based therapies in obesity and type 2 diabetes
